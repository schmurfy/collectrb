This very simple Ruby class sends monitoring statistics to a collectd server
using the collectd UDP protocol. See http://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Binary_protocol
It supports gauges, counters, derive, and absolute data types. It does not (yet) support other types.

The Collectd class is entirely passive and relies on being called to send values, it thus functions best
in a daemon that runs periodically and collects data that can then be pushed to collectd.
